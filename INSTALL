 The IQ Calculator doesn't really need installation. It
 can be run from any local directory.
 
 Acquire the needed files by cloning the Github repo:
 git clone https://github.com/ShellCanToo/iQalc
 Or download a zipped snapshot of the repo from:
 https://github.com/ShellCanToo/iQalc/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
 
        Local Mini Installation
 Simply copy the top-level files you need into your PATH.
 The main files 'iq' and 'iq+' should be made executable, using
 the command 'chmod +x iq iq+'. 
 
 The other 2 top-level files: 'iq_trig.sh' and 'iq_misc.sh' 
 should also be copied to the same location as 'iq' and 'iq+',
 but should remain non-executable. They are loadable modules 
 used by 'iq' and 'iq+' and can not be run as 'programs'.
 'iq_util.sh' and 'iq_ai.sh' are optional modules. To use them,
 copy into your PATH.
 
 The directory 'man' contains man-pages for each program and
 module, in both MarkDown and roff-formatted man-pages.
 
 The directory 'math.h.sh' contains the IQ Calculator, in the
 form of a 'header' for including IQ in shell scripts.
